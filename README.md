<h1>SNAKES!</h1>

The game's objective is to move the snake around a defined grid and grabbing the apple that randomly appears. 

The more apples the snake gets, the more it grows.

I decided to go with the blue option and put the text and 'How to Play' under the stage image.
It's much cleaner and less compacted. I also decided against a hamburger menu for now as there's isn't that much options like High Scores html which is still in alpha.

Originally, I had setup the grid to be 10x10 but as I gradually played around with the width and height; I was able to expand it to 20x20. Also, the original two stages were created using for loop and div, if time permits, I will create another stage using canvas.
